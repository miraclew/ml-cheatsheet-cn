Introduction
============

You need to know some basic calculus in order to understand how functions change over time (derivatives), and to calculate the total amount of a quantity that accumulates over a time period (integrals). The language of calculus will allow you to speak precisely about the properties of functions and better understand their behaviour.

Normally taking a calculus course involves doing lots of tedious calculations by hand, but having the power of computers on your side can make the process much more fun. This section describes the key ideas of calculus which you'll need to know to understand machine learning concepts.
